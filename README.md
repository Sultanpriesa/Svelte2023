## Choose a topic and three example sites from which you want to incorporate elements
   Topic: The site will revolve around formula 1 racing witch includes the about, teams and general information about the topic.
   Example Sites:
     1. https://www.tuqr.nl/
         Clean and Minimalistic Design: The website has a clean, minimalistic design that follows a common principle of modern web design. It helps in reducing clutter 
                                        and ensuring that the content is easy to read and navigate. Furthermore, I like how when you scroll down a car appears towards the 
                                        screen and once it passes the page actually scrolls.
     2. https://ethos-fitness-sport-template.webflow.io/
         Call-to-Action (CTA) Button: The prominent CTA button is strategically placed in this website appealed to me, this encourages users to take action. The use of a 
                                      contrasting color for the CTA button makes it stand out and attracts the user's attention.
     2. https://affectsound.com/
         Scroll-Activated Animations: As you scroll down the site, I noticed the animations that are triggered, providing an interactive and engaging experience. This 
                                      approach aligns with the principles of user engagement and interactivity in modern web design.

## What specific elements will you incorporate into your own design? How? Where can they be seen in your assignment?
        1. Clean Design: In my design, I will focus on maintaining a clean and clutter-free layout. Use ample white space, clear typography, and minimalistic elements 
                        to guide users' attention to the most critical content.
        2. Background Effects: Utilize background effects like gradients, videos, or parallax scrolling to make your website more visually engaging.
        3. Parallax Scrolling: Where the background moves at a different speed than the foreground. This creates a visually engaging experience, and because parallax 
                              scrolling is a popular technique in modern web  design for adding depth and interactivity.
